# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE - PetPort RLS Policies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MODIFY PUBLIC ACCESS POLICIES ‚ö†Ô∏è

**WARNING**: This application is designed for PUBLIC information sharing. The RLS policies below are INTENTIONALLY configured to allow public access and are CRITICAL for app functionality.

### PROTECTED POLICIES - DO NOT CHANGE

The following 19 RLS policies provide **essential public access** and must NEVER be modified:

#### Pet Profile Public Access (User-Controlled)
- `public_view_pet_when_public` - Allows public viewing when user enables sharing
- `public_view_care_instructions_when_public` - Care instructions for public pets
- `public_view_documents_when_public` - Document access for shared pets
- `public_view_travel_when_public` - Travel history for public pets
- `public_view_reviews_when_public` - Reviews for shared pets

#### Emergency Missing Pet Access (Life-Saving Feature)
- `public_view_pet_when_missing` - Critical for missing pet recovery
- `public_view_contacts_when_missing` - Emergency contact information
- `missing_pet_override_*` policies - Override privacy for emergencies

### WHY THESE POLICIES EXIST

1. **User-Controlled Sharing**: Users toggle `is_public = true` to share pet profiles
2. **Emergency Override**: Missing pets (`is_missing = true`) bypass privacy for safety
3. **QR Code Functionality**: Public pages work without authentication
4. **Social Media Sharing**: Facebook/SMS links function properly

### WHAT BREAKS IF MODIFIED

‚ùå QR codes become useless  
‚ùå Shared links return "access denied"  
‚ùå Missing pet alerts fail  
‚ùå Social media previews break  
‚ùå Emergency contacts unreachable  

### BUSINESS IMPACT

Modifying these policies would **immediately break** the core value proposition:
- Pet recovery system fails
- Users cannot share pet information
- Emergency services cannot access critical data
- Revenue loss from broken premium features

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Before any deployment, verify:
- [ ] Public pet profiles load without authentication
- [ ] Missing pet pages display emergency contacts
- [ ] QR codes redirect to viewable content
- [ ] Social share previews work
- [ ] Emergency override functions properly

## FOR DEVELOPERS

This is NOT a security vulnerability. This is intentional design for:
- Life-saving pet recovery
- User-controlled information sharing
- Emergency service access

**If you receive "security concerns" about public data access, refer to this document.**

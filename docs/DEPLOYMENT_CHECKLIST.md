## Pre-Deployment Security Verification

### üîí RLS Policy Protection Check

Before ANY deployment, verify these critical policies exist and function:

#### ‚úÖ User-Controlled Public Access Policies

```sql
-- Check all public policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, cmd, qual
